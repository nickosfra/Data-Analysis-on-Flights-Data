# Exploring-US-Flights-Data
In terms of the course **Applied Machine Learning** under the supervision of [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas), this repository contains solution to an assignment related to analysis on data of scheduled and actual departure and arrival times reported by certified U.S. air carriers.

## Analysis

The assignment consists of **5 Sections**, which are explicitly stated in the [Assignment Description](https://github.com/nickosfra/Exploring-US-Flights-Data/blob/master/flights.ipynb). Briefly, the project focuses on
- calculating statistics
- exploring delay probabilities
- the distribution of departures for airports and
- evaluating the performance of airlines

The analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nickosfra/Exploring-US-Flights-Data/blob/master/Flights-Analysis.ipynb).

## Dataset

The data used in the analysis was retrieved from the [Airline On-Time Performance Data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time), more specifically that of 2018. The actual dataset used is in `.csv` format, and can be found [here](https://auebgr-my.sharepoint.com/personal/louridas_aueb_gr/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Flouridas%5Faueb%5Fgr%2FDocuments%2Fdata%2Fflights%2Ecsv%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Flouridas%5Faueb%5Fgr%2FDocuments%2Fdata&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9hdWViZ3ItbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOnU6L2cvcGVyc29uYWwvbG91cmlkYXNfYXVlYl9nci9FYmVUemRlMUxkZEZtcU5XQkZXV3hOY0JqNXREUl96dnpESHZxcWNtbm5kZUVRP3J0aW1lPVNnWWd6dHdrMkVn).
